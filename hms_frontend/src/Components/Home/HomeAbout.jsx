          Education is a lifelong learning process which meets a variety of needs across industries, businesses and communities. It includes skills training or upgrading of skills and acquiring knowledge through competency based education. We live in a world where everything is changing. However, there are two things which are a constant, change and the process of learning. In this everchanging and evergrowing industrial world, education is required for everyone to stay current with the latest trends, developments, skills, and new technologies required in various fields. We offer students myriad experiences and also encourage them to participate in various activities to help them build a thought process, independent of apprehensions and one that develops a sensitivity within themselves.
